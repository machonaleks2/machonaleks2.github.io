# To Wypada

I had an opportunity to do a website for To Wypada. To Wypada is a polish starting social campaign, which aims to increase social awareness about culture and good manners. It ts being made with the help of a platform created by the Polish "Zwolnieni z Teorii" Foundation. To make a website I used jekyll. The theme/template I used was Jekyll Serif made by [zerostatic.io](https://www.zerostatic.io/)
