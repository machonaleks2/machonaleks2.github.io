# Synthwave Radio

Synthwave radio is an idle interactive game that offers a relaxing and immersive experience. Set to the backdrop of synthwave music, the game puts you in the driver's seat of a car as it glides along a picturesque highway. The game is designed to provide a calming sensory experience, perfect for those who seek threshold stimulation or simply want to unwind after a long day.

The game requires minimal interaction from the player - you don't need to steer, accelerate or brake the car. Instead, you can sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. The car will drive by itself, as you immerse yourself in the retro-futuristic visuals of the highway and the pulsing sounds of synthwave.

The graphics are deliberately low-key and minimalistic. The game's interface is clean, with easy-to-use controls and an unobtrusive user interface.Synthwave radio is an ideal game for people who want to experience a moment of tranquility and escape from the stresses of everyday life. It is a game that requires no skills or previous experience, and is accessible to everyone.

# What it features?

The game does not have many features to make it very easy to play. 

You may look around as you drive through the highway, looking at you surroundings. There are two white buttons which you can click to change music. 

In the future I plan on adding a custom music feature which would enable adding your own favourite songs to the game.
